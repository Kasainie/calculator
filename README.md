Simple Python Calculator 
This little program can do basic math for you: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It's designed to be super easy to use, especially if you're just starting out with Python.

 How to Use It
Using this calculator is a breeze!

Save the Code: First, make sure you have the Python code saved in a file on your computer. You can name it something like calculator.py.

Open a Terminal/Command Prompt: This is where you'll run your Python programs.

On Windows, search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell."

On Mac/Linux, search for "Terminal."

Navigate to the Folder: Use the cd command to go to the folder where you saved calculator.py. For example, if it's in a folder called MyPythonProjects on your Desktop, you might type:

cd Desktop/MyPythonProjects

Run the Program: Once you're in the right folder, type:

python calculator.py

Follow the Prompts: The program will then ask you to:

Enter the first number: (Type a number, like 10 or 3.5)

Enter the second number: (Type another number, like 5 or 2.0)

Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): (Type one of these symbols: +, -, *, or /)

After you enter everything, it will show you the result!

 How It Works (A Little Secret!)
Most calculators use if statements (like "IF the user types +, THEN add"). But this calculator uses a neat trick called a dictionary!

Imagine a dictionary like a special phone book for operations:

When you type +, the dictionary immediately knows to call the "add" function.

When you type -, it calls the "subtract" function.

This way, the program finds the right math job to do without needing a long list of if checks! It's a clever way to keep the code simple and organized. We also have some "safety nets" (try...except) to catch common mistakes like typing letters instead of numbers, or trying to divide by zero.

ðŸ›  What You'll Need
Python: You'll need Python installed on your computer (version 3.6 or newer is great). You can download it from python.org.

Enjoy using your simple Python calculator!
